Changelog
==========

- 1.8.2: April 17, 2020
  - Reorganized build system to avoid saving generated files into the
    Git repository.
  - Tweaked newlines.
  - Set the Java target version to 1.8, so that we can support more recent versions of macOS.

- 1.8: June 22, 2015
    - Used 'codesign' to sign "Sequence Matrix.app" as this might prevent
      it from being recognized on MacOS X systems.
       - Thanks to Shiyu Phan for this suggestion!

- 1.7.9
    - Turned off displaying 'N's in the display, as we don't re-export
      those anyway.
    - Fixed a bug in the Cluster tool reported by Michael Balke: single
      species without conspecific sequences in the dataset were being
      reported as 'Split'.

- 1.7.8
    - Added DOI to the citation for Sequence Matrix.

- 1.7.7-dev4
    - Naked Nexus now replaces all non-alphanumeric characters with underscores.

- 1.7.7-dev3
    - Fixed a minor bug with clustering in which the "% of valid comparisons
      above the threshold" number was always 0%.
    - Fixed a bug in which multiple "Cluster" analyses in the same session
      caused the ProgressDialog to never close, resulting in the program
      getting "stuck" and a forced quit becoming necessary.

- 1.7.7-dev2
    - Rewrote SpeciesDetails to remove the old, bug-ridden algorithm.
      The new one will probably actually work.
    - Added discrimination between "Split only", "Lumped/Split" and
      "Lumped" for clusters in Cluster.

- 1.7.6 (June 6, 2010)
    - Added code to detect overlapping codonsets on input (#19).
    - Fixed a bug relating to TNT files exported into directory (#55).
